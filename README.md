## ❓ What is SynthKernel?

SynthKernel is a low-level TypeScript architecture for building structured [modular monoliths](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/what-is-a-modular-monolith/?spm=a2ty_o01.29997173.0.0.4f2555fbU2saKo)
. It combines OOP, advanced generics, and the Facade Pattern to push Inversion of Control to its extremum.

Unlike conventional loaders that expose APIs, SynthKernel’s loader strictly manages lifecycles and acts as a facade. **Modules are the true center**: they define APIs, execute logic, augment the loader, and wire dependencies. This results in an application structure clearly representable as a tree diagram. The philosophy is universally applicable across software, OS design, and robotics.

## 🔑 Core Problem It Solves

SynthKernel eliminates the architectural friction of "God Objects" and manual registries by enforcing a type-safe, modular composition model. It leverages TypeScript’s type system to automatically orchestrate capabilities, ensuring that adding a feature instantly augments both runtime behavior and static types. This guarantees strict modularity, zero configuration drift, and inherent testability without sacrificing scalability.

## 📰 Whitepaper

SynthKernel provides a Jupyter Notebook whitepaper running TypeScript, you can find it here: [SynthKernel Whitepaper](https://github.com/hesprs/synthkernel/blob/main/whitepaper.ipynb).

Prerequisites to correctly execute the whitepaper:

- Jupyter Lab
- Python 3
- Node.js & pnpm

After cloning the repository, run the following commands to set up the environment:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm tslab install # register TS kernel
```

Then open `whitepaper.ipynb` in your viewer (Jupyter WebUI or VSCode), choose the TS kernel. Now you can read the notebook.

## 🤖 Agent Skill

SynthKernel is 100% AI-native, a skill is written to make agents more comfortable when navigating inside a SynthKernel repo.

WARNING: SynthKernel does enforce very strict and opinionated naming, architecture and file system conventions, and is still in experimental phase.

**To install the skill**:

Choose `npx` / `pnpm dlx` / `bunx` or whatever according your preference, take `npx` as an example:

```sh
npx skills add hesprs/synthkernel
```

The command will scaffold and find 1 skill. Then select the coding agent, whether to install globally and installation method according to your needs. Continue the scaffolder and the skill will be installed.
